# willow-ctf

A ctf challenge made with **docker** and **docker-compose** for my college project.

There are three challenges in this ctf related to **web server** related **vulnerabilites**. <br />
 - basicpen <br />
 - exit <br />
 - vulner <br />

Once you install docker and docker-compose, run the following command to get the server up and running. <br />
    - docker-compose up
    
A writeup for basicpen has been provided.

Note: freessh is only a ssh server which i intended to provide for a public reverse ssh connection.
