# willow-ctf
Willow-ctf consists of simple ctf challenges made with **[docker](https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io)** & **[docker-compose](https://github.com/docker/compose)** for my college project.

There are three challenges in this ctf related to **web server vulnerabilites**. <br />
 - basicpen <br />
 - exit (blind from [TAMUctf2020](https://github.com/tamuctf/TAMUctf-2020/tree/master/Misc/blind) )<br />
 - vulner <br />

Once you install docker and docker-compose, run the following command in a challenge directory to get the server up and running. <br />
    - docker-compose up
    
A writeup for basicpen has been provided.

Note: freessh is only a ssh server which i intended to provide for users to create a public reverse ssh connection (reverse shell).
